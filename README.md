## What's New in v0.8.0 — Browser QA-Loop + Persistent Profile Harness

v0.7 emitted a runnable Python+Playwright project from XAML but stopped short of running it. v0.8 closes that loop: after the migrator emits, the lifecycle agent now **runs the artifact against the live target, captures Playwright failures, auto-patches, and retries** — the same build → test → fix → retest pattern Playwright-CLI users drive by hand, but wired into the existing `FaultFixer` Protocol so it composes with the v0.7 self-healing swarm.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**`BrowserSession` — persistent profile harness** — Single async context manager (`rpa_architect.selectors.browser_session`) wraps `async_playwright()` with two modes: ephemeral (`pw.chromium.launch()` — today's harvest behavior) or persistent (`pw.chromium.launch_persistent_context(user_data_dir=…)` — cookies, localStorage, IndexedDB, service workers all survive across runs). Headed-by-default to match interactive iteration; `RPA_HEADLESS=1` flips to headless for CI without code changes. `RPA_USER_DATA_DIR=/path` enables persistence the same way. `BrowserHarvester.HarvestConfig` gained the same field, so harvest runs against Odoo / SuiteCRM / Orchestrator UI can finally skip re-login. Migrator-emitted `main.py` consumes the same env vars (no `rpa_architect` import — the generated project stays standalone).

</td>
<td width="50%">

**`MigratorQAFixer` — sister to `SwarmFaultFixer`** — Implements the existing `FaultFixer` Protocol (`lifecycle/fault_fixer.py`), claims python+playwright artifacts (`failure.xaml_files` empty + `project_dir/main.py` exists — mutex with `SwarmFaultFixer` which owns the XAML lane). Two narrow remediations: `TimeoutException` bumps every `timeout=N` kwarg in `processes/*.py` by +5 s (capped at 30 s) via atomic temp-file + `os.replace`; `SelectorNotFoundException` escalates with structured pointers to the offending files (re-harvesting needs a target URL the fix layer doesn't always have). Regex matches inside `await page.…(…)` calls only — comments, docstrings, and string literals containing `timeout=…` are left alone. Registered ahead of `SwarmFaultFixer` in `_resolve_fixer_pipeline`; `FixProposalFixer` remains the catch-all tail.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**`QALoopRunner` + `MigratorQALoop`** — `QALoopRunner` (`lifecycle/qa_loop.py`) executes `python main.py` from a migrator-emitted project in an `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` (clean isolation; the emitted project depends only on Playwright, not on `rpa_architect`). On non-zero exit, parses the traceback and maps it to the same `exception_type` strings `FixProposalFixer._EXCEPTION_TYPE_MAP` already uses (`TimeoutException`, `SelectorNotFoundException`, `NullReferenceException`, …) so a single convention drives both fix paths. `MigratorQALoop` (`lifecycle/migrator_qa_orchestrator.py`) drives runner → registry → runner with a bounded budget (default 3 iterations); stops on pass, on escalation, or budget-exhausted. Same primitives as the LangGraph fix branch (`FixerRegistry`, `FailureBundle`, `FixOutcome`) — just orchestrated for the migrator-output domain.

</td>
<td width="50%">

**LangGraph integration — `qa_run` stage** — New `qa_run_node` sits between `validate_gate` and `deploy`, gated on `state.authoring.migrator_output_dir`. When set: runs `MigratorQALoop`, populates `state.errors` with the report summary; conditional edges route pass → `deploy`, fail → `END` (don't ship a broken artifact). When empty (the default): no-op passthrough, so all 184 pre-existing lifecycle tests + the v0.7 baseline pass unchanged. The QA loop is intentionally NOT plugged into the diagnose/fix loop — `MigratorQALoop` already has its own internal retry budget; looping again at the graph level would just multiply iterations.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**Demo — `proof/demo_qa_loop.py`** — Self-contained: stdlib HTTP server with a button injected after 4 s, real `emit_project()` output (XAML → IR → Python+Playwright), `processes/*.py` post-emit-patched with a deliberately tight `timeout=1500` to force iteration 1 to fail, `MigratorQAFixer` bumps to 6500 ms, iteration 2 passes. Mirrors the YouTube Playwright-CLI workflow applied to this repo's actual subject (UiPath migration), not a generic form demo. `--headless` flag for CI, `--keep` to inspect the generated project.

</td>
<td width="50%">

**Skill pack — `.claude/skills/browser-qa-loop/`** — Documents the four primitives (`BrowserSession` / `QALoopRunner` / `MigratorQAFixer` / `MigratorQALoop`), the headed-by-default rationale, the `RPA_USER_DATA_DIR` persistent-profile recipe, and the failure-bundle exception-type conventions shared with `FixProposalFixer`. Sister to the existing `uipath-community-cloud-gotchas` and `reframework-coded-workflow` skills — short, opinionated, AI-navigable. Reviewed mid-implementation by GLM 5.1 (per the project's mandatory multi-model deliberation rule); three issues caught and fixed with regression tests before commit.

## What's New in v0.7.0 — Self-Healing Swarm + XAML Migrator

v0.5 and v0.6 closed the _author → deploy → monitor_ loop. v0.7 closes the other half: **keep deployed bots alive** and **retire legacy XAML estates**. Two features, one shared XAML-AST foundation.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**Self-Healing Swarm** — When a deployed job faults, a LangGraph sub-graph fans out to four parallel specialists (`selector_repair`, `null_exception`, `timing_repair`, `business_rule`). Each inspects the `FailureBundle` — exception, robot logs, and the deployed `.nupkg` unpacked to its original XAMLs — and either emits a `FixCandidate` with a concrete `XamlPatch` or returns `None`. The arbiter prefers actionable candidates over high-confidence diagnostics; the staging validator deploys the winning patch to a `Shared/Staging` folder, runs one transaction, and only on success does `gh pr create` open a PR against `main` with the exception, before/after selector diff, rationale, and staging run URL. The original `diagnose → propose_fix` path remains available for escalations the swarm cannot auto-patch.

</td>
<td width="50%">

**Shared XAML-AST layer** — `rpa_architect.xaml_ast` (`read_xaml`, `write_xaml`, `extract_selectors`, `patch_selector`) parses UiPath XAML via `lxml` with XXE-hardened settings, builds a typed tree of `XamlActivity` / `XamlSelector` / `XamlDocument` dataclasses, flattens property-element wrappers (`<ui:Click.Target>`), and preserves attribute order + namespace declarations on round-trip so UiPath Studio's diff stays clean. Every selector carries a direct `lxml` element reference, bypassing xpath-evaluator fragility across XAML's mixed default/prefixed namespaces. 31 tests including XXE entity-expansion hardening and REFramework `Main.xaml.j2` round-trip fidelity.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**Four specialists, one arbiter** — `SelectorRepairSpecialist` is the only agent that auto-patches: it matches the broken selector by activity display name or selector fragment, delegates to an injected `Harvester` (Playwright adapter in prod, `FakeHarvester` in tests), and writes the replacement via `patch_selector` + `write_xaml`. The other three refuse to guess — `NullExceptionSpecialist` emits `code_bug` with 0.45 confidence and no patches, `TimingRepairSpecialist` emits `system_timeout` with 0.55 and no patches, `BusinessRuleSpecialist` always escalates (business rules are semantic, not bugs). The arbiter's rules are pure-functional: prefer candidates with patches, tie-break on confidence, escalate on empty.

</td>
<td width="50%">

**XAML → Python+Playwright Migrator** _(scoped to REFramework dispatcher)_ — `rpa_architect.migrator.lift_xaml_bundle` walks `Main.xaml` via the shared xaml_ast, asserts the four canonical REFramework states (`Init`, `GetTransactionData`, `ProcessTransaction`, `EndProcess`), then lifts `Process.xaml`'s UI activities into `ProcessIR.transactions[0].steps`. `emit_project(ir, out_dir)` renders `main.py` + `processes/process_<tx>.py` + `tests/test_parity_<tx>.py` + `pyproject.toml`. Every generated `.py` passes `ast.parse`; `proof/demo_migrate.py` exercises the full pipeline on a 7-activity fixture (TypeInto, SelectItem, Check, Click, WaitUiElementAppear, GetText) in <1 s. Anything outside the REFramework shape raises `UnsupportedPatternError` with the specific violation — no silent partial migrations.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**Demo script — `proof/demo_self_heal.py`** — Offline mode (default) drives the swarm against an `httpx.MockTransport` Orchestrator and a `FakeRunner` for `gh`/`git`. Asserts: the patched `Main.xaml` no longer contains `submit-invoice-btn-stale`, now contains the harvested replacement, a PR URL came back from `gh pr create`, and staging reported Successful. Live mode (`RPA_LIVE=1 --live --job-id <key>`) hits real Community Cloud via `build_default_swarm`. Runs in <1 second offline.

</td>
<td width="50%">

**LangGraph integration is opt-in** — `create_lifecycle_graph(swarm=None)` preserves v0.6 behavior. When called with a `SwarmOrchestrator`, a new `swarm_heal` node sits between `diagnose` and `propose_fix`, routing PR-opened → `END` and escalation → `propose_fix`. 165 tests green (64 new v0.7, 101 existing lifecycle untouched). The swarm state carries a `swarm_pr_url` + `swarm_requires_escalation` on `LifecycleState`; the existing `approval_gate` owns human review when escalation fires.

## What's New in v0.6.0 — Claims Adjudication Factory (Dispatcher + Performer + Reporter)

The v0.5 Invoice Factory was a single-process REFramework state machine. v0.6 is the next tier: **three separately-packaged UiPath processes** coordinating through an Orchestrator queue, targeting medical insurance claims adjudication in SuiteCRM 8. Built to stress the Community Cloud free tier — 1 unattended robot slot, no schedule trigger API, .NET 8 Portable runtime — with a 2-hour SLA target of 50 claims/hour.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**Dispatcher + Performer + Reporter pattern** — Three `.nupkg`s (each a standalone Portable project) coordinating via a shared Orchestrator queue (`MedicalClaims`). Dispatcher pulls new-status Cases from SuiteCRM and pushes queue items. Performer reads Queued cases directly from SuiteCRM (BW-19: `StartTransaction` requires robot-session context, external-app tokens get 204), runs the 5-rule adjudication engine, writes verdicts + audit notes back. Reporter aggregates queue history, renders an HTML SLA report. Each process has byte-identical copies of the shared C# sources — enforced by a test — because UiPath Community Cloud's NuGet feed silently strips cross-package references at pack time. **Live-validated: 100 claims adjudicated on Community Cloud in 5 minutes.**

</td>
<td width="50%">

**5-rule medical claims adjudication engine** — `CoverageVerificationRule` (in-memory against pre-fetched Policy), `AmountThresholdRule` (>$10k flag, >$100k deny), `DocumentationCompletenessRule` (counts Notes, denies insufficient docs for E&M procedures), `NetworkProviderRule` (live SuiteCRM lookup, flags out-of-network), `FraudVelocityRule` (≥4 claims same claimant 30d → deny, 2-3 → flag). Rules ordered cheap→expensive so deterministic denies short-circuit before SuiteCRM round-trips. FlagForReview reasons accumulate across rules.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**SuiteCRM 8 OAuth2 REST adapter** — `SuiteCrmClient.cs` generator emits a complete client with OAuth2 password grant, token caching, **401 refresh-retry (BW-15 mitigation)** for Laravel Passport's aggressive token eviction at ~50 min idle, and seven API methods including the **Notes-as-documents substitute (BW-13)** — SuiteCRM 8's Documents REST endpoint is broken upstream (GitHub Issue #10794, open since 2020, reopened April 2026). The client routes around it by storing claim documents as Notes with `parent_type="Cases"`.

</td>
<td width="50%">

**Verdict-distribution drift detection** — `MetricsStore` schema migrated non-destructively to add `verdicts_by_category` column. `detect_drift()` gains a fourth drift type (`verdict_distribution_shift`) firing when any categorical outcome (auto_approve / flag_for_review / deny) shifts >10% relative to the rolling baseline. Requires baseline count ≥ 5 to avoid first-run false positives. Wired into `lifecycle.diagnosis` so a rule-verdict cluster short-circuits to `business_rule_violation` category with confidence 0.9.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**9 new brick walls documented** — BW-13 through BW-26, discovered during live deployment to Community Cloud + SuiteCRM 8. Highlights: SuiteCRM Documents REST broken (BW-13, use Notes), StartTransaction needs robot session context (BW-19, Performer reads SuiteCRM directly), all SuiteCRM filters require `[eq]` operator (BW-20), uipcli namespace mismatch for CodedWorkflow (BW-18, Main class in project namespace + `[Workflow]` on method), project.json `main` must point to `.cs` file not `Main.xaml` (BW-22). Every wall documented with live error messages + workaround in `docs/brick_walls/`.

</td>
<td width="50%">

**2-hour SLA stress proof** — `proof/run_sla_claims.py` orchestrates: (1) seed 100 Cases to SuiteCRM via the seed client (95 clean + 5 deterministic faults, one per rule), (2) external cron ticks every 2 min invoking Dispatcher then Performer with BW-14 collision-skip logic, (3) Reporter aggregation + HTML render, (4) drift + diagnosis verification, (5) final self-contained HTML SLA report. Target: 50 claims/hour × 2 hours with ≥95% success rate and p50 latency ≤72s. Fault injection deliberately triggers every rule so drift detector validates live.

## What's New in v0.5.0 — Enterprise Invoice Processing Factory

A full end-to-end build targeting **UiPath Community Cloud's Linux serverless robot**, compile-verified and live-deployed against a self-hosted Odoo 17 ERP. Every claim below is backed by runnable scripts in `proof/` and structural tests in `tests/`.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**16-file REFramework-as-C#-CodedWorkflow** — The classic Init → GetTransactionData → Process → SetTransactionStatus → End state machine translated into compiled C# (`src/rpa_architect/codegen/reframework_csharp_gen.py`). Runs inside a `[Workflow] CodedWorkflow` class on .NET 8 / Portable so it loads on the Linux serverless robot where `ui:*` activities silently fail. Compile-verified on every test run via real `dotnet build`.

</td>
<td width="50%">

**Real Odoo 17 JSON-RPC adapter** — `OdooClient.cs` handles cookie session auth, idempotent vendor lookup/create, multi-currency `account.move` creation with `invoice_line_ids` ORM command tuples, inactive-currency activation (EUR/GBP ship inactive in Odoo 17), and manager-approval tasks via `mail.activity.activity_schedule` (the Community-tier substitute for Action Center).

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**Document Understanding Cloud API v2 client** — `DocumentUnderstandingClient.cs` calls the DU v2 REST endpoints directly (`cloud.uipath.com/{org}/{tenant}/du_/api/framework/...`) because `UiPath.IntelligentOCR.Activities` is Windows-only and won't load in Portable. Includes a graceful `DuApiScopeMissingException` fallback to `LocalInvoiceExtractor` so the pipeline runs end-to-end even without DU scopes on the external app.

</td>
<td width="50%">

**4-rule BusinessRuleEngine** — `IRule` interface + chain evaluator + 4 real rules: `CurrencyWhitelistRule` (USD/EUR/GBP), `DuplicateInvoiceRule` (`search_count` on Odoo), `VendorKycRule` (`search_read` on `res.partner`), `AmountThresholdRule` (>$2,500 USD normalized). Deterministic ordering, fail-fast on first non-`AutoProcess` verdict, explicit `BusinessException` vs `RpaSystemException` discipline.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**Honest Community Cloud limitations doc** — `docs/community_cloud_limitations.md` catalogues 12 brick walls hit live during the April 2026 build with stack traces, error codes (2818, 1015, `invalid_scope`, `ArgumentNullException path2`), and the workaround for each. No "it should work" guesses — only what was verified against the live tenant.

</td>
<td width="50%">

**Maestro design assets as siblings** — BPMN 2.0 + DMN 1.3 files emitted next to the `.nupkg` (not bundled inside — Orchestrator silently ignores extras). Manual Studio Web import guide at `docs/maestro_studio_web_import.md`. Because as of 2025.10 / 2026 Maestro has **no public deployment API** — verified across OData `$metadata`, docs.uipath.com, and cross-model research.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**Real vendor-name agent (`agent_scaffold_gen.py`)** — Deployable UiPath Python SDK scaffold generating a real vendor-name normalizer + invoice classifier: regex-based corporate-suffix stripping across 18 formats, 5 known-alias patterns, 5 category rules, and an optional Anthropic LLM supplement with rule-wins-ties audit discipline. Ships with 25 parameterized pytest tests that execute on the generated code.

</td>
<td width="50%">

**Claude Code skills / commands / subagent / MCP tools** — `.claude/skills/` packs the 3 hardest-earned knowledge sets (Community Cloud gotchas, Odoo JSON-RPC patterns, REFramework-as-CodedWorkflow template) as invocable skills. `/uipath-deploy` and `/uipath-verify-package` slash commands wrap the live deploy + 17-assertion package verification. `uipath-rpa-architect` subagent (Opus) for architecture-level tasks. 3 new MCP tools: `generate_enterprise_reframework`, `verify_package_contents`, `get_community_cloud_gotchas`.

## 🌐 Live Browser Selector Harvesting

> **Production-ready UiPath selectors from real UIs** — Playwright navigates to actual application URLs found in the PDD, discovers interactive elements via DOM + accessibility tree, and generates stable UiPath selectors automatically.

### How It Works

 ▼
📦 .objects/ (production-ready selectors)
```

### Usage

```bash
# Generate with live browser harvesting (headless)
rpa-architect generate ./pdd.pdf -o ./output --harvest-selectors

# Generate from IR with visible browser (for debugging)
rpa-architect generate-from-ir ./ir.json -o ./output --harvest-selectors --harvest-headed

# Install Playwright (one-time setup)
pip install -e ".[harvest]"
playwright install chromium
```

### Credential Configuration

For systems requiring login, set environment variables per system:

```bash
# Format: HARVEST_CRED_{SYSTEM_NAME}_USER / HARVEST_CRED_{SYSTEM_NAME}_PASS
export HARVEST_CRED_INVOICEPORTAL_USER=admin@company.com
export HARVEST_CRED_INVOICEPORTAL_PASS=secretpass
export HARVEST_CRED_ERPSYSTEM_USER=svc_account
export HARVEST_CRED_ERPSYSTEM_PASS=erp_password
```

System names are uppercased with non-alphanumeric characters replaced by underscores (e.g., `SAP GUI` becomes `SAP_GUI`).

### Fallback Chain

The harvesting system is designed to never block project generation:

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Element matched in browser | Production-ready UiPath selector |
| Element not matched | Falls back to TODO placeholder |
| Step navigation fails | Warning logged; step gets placeholders |
| Login fails | Harvests pre-login page only |
| Browser launch fails | Entire system falls back to placeholders |
| Playwright not installed | All placeholders (current default behavior) |

Each system gets its own browser context — one system failure doesn't affect others.

### MCP Tool

The harvest is also available as a standalone MCP tool:

```python
# Harvest selectors for all web systems
tool_harvest_selectors_live(ir_json="...", headless=True)

# Harvest for a specific system only
tool_harvest_selectors_live(ir_json="...", system_name="InvoicePortal")
```

### Settings

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `HARVEST_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable harvesting globally |
| `HARVEST_HEADLESS` | `true` | Run browser in headless mode |
| `HARVEST_TIMEOUT_MS` | `30000` | Navigation timeout (ms) |
| `HARVEST_MAX_ELEMENTS_PER_PAGE` | `200` | Max elements to discover per page |

### Testing the Feature

```bash
# Run all 83 harvest-related tests
pytest tests/test_selectors/ -v

# Run specific test modules
pytest tests/test_selectors/test_uipath_converter.py -v    # 27 tests: selector conversion
pytest tests/test_selectors/test_element_matcher.py -v      # 22 tests: heuristic + LLM matching
pytest tests/test_selectors/test_browser_harvester.py -v    # 16 tests: Playwright orchestration

## 🎭 UiPath Maestro Workflow Generation

> **Full support for UiPath Maestro** — the cloud-native orchestration platform for coordinating RPA bots, AI agents, APIs, and humans in a single workflow.

### What Gets Generated

| Artifact | Format | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| 📋 **Process Workflows** | `.bpmn` | BPMN 2.0 definitions with start/end events, service tasks, user tasks, gateways, and sequence flows |
| 📊 **Decision Tables** | `.dmn` | DMN 1.3 business rules extracted from the PDD, evaluated at runtime |
| 🔗 **Service Bindings** | XML | Each BPMN service task bound to a generated REFramework bot, AI agent, or API workflow |
| 👤 **User Tasks** | BPMN | Human-in-the-loop steps routed to UiPath Action Center for approvals and reviews |
| ⚡ **Expressions** | JavaScript | Data transformations and variable mappings between tasks |

### 🔍 Auto-Detection: REFramework vs Maestro vs Hybrid

The tool analyzes the IR and **automatically selects** the best output mode:

```
                        ┌─────────────────────┐
                        │   Analyze Process    │

            │ Single   │  │ Multi-actor   │  │ Hybrid  │
            │ bot,     │  │ human-in-the- │  │ complex │
            │ queue    │  │ loop, DMN     │  │ both    │
            └────┬─────┘  └──────┬───────┘  └────┬────┘
                 ▼               ▼               ▼
           REFramework       Maestro          Hybrid
          (XAML + C#)     (BPMN + DMN)    (Maestro + REF)
```

| Scenario | Detection Signal | Output |
|----------|-----------------|--------|
| Single-bot transactional processing | Queue-based, single system | **REFramework** |
| Multi-actor orchestration | Multiple actor types, external APIs | **Maestro** |
| Long-running with human approvals | Approval/review steps detected | **Maestro** |
| Processes with business rules | Complex routing/escalation rules | **Maestro + DMN** |
| Complex hybrid orchestration | Mix of above signals | **Maestro** orchestrating **REFramework** bots |

Override with `--mode maestro|reframework|hybrid`.

### 🔀 Hybrid Mode

In hybrid mode, the tool generates **both** Maestro and REFramework artifacts working together:

```
🎭 Maestro BPMN (top-level orchestrator)
 │
 ├─── ⚙️ Service Task ──► "Extract Invoice"    → REFramework bot (generated)
 ├─── 📊 Business Rule ──► "Validate Amount"   → DMN decision table (generated)

## 🎯 Intelligent Selector Generation

> **4-tier strategy** for generating UiPath UI selectors — from live browser-harvested production selectors to AI-inferred selectors from screenshots.

### Tier 0: 🌐 Live Browser Harvesting (NEW)

Playwright navigates to actual application URLs, discovers real DOM elements, and generates production-ready selectors. See [Live Browser Selector Harvesting](#-live-browser-selector-harvesting) for full details.

### Tier 1: 🗂️ Object Repository Generation

Generates `.objects/` directory with structured JSON descriptors for each target application:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "1.0",
  "name": "InvoicePortal",
  "screens": [
    {
      "name": "LoginPage",
      "elements": [
        {
          "name": "UsernameField",
          "selector": "<html app='chrome.exe' /><webctrl tag='input' id='username' />",
          "action": "type_into"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Tier 2: 📝 Placeholder Selectors with TODO Markers

For unknown applications, generates well-structured placeholder selectors with clear TODO markers:

```xml
<!-- TODO: Capture actual selector for InvoicePortal.LoginPage.UsernameField -->
<html app='chrome.exe' title='*Invoice*' />
  <webctrl tag='input' aaname='username' />
```

Each placeholder includes the semantic element name, expected action type, and suggested attributes based on the element's role in the process.

### Tier 3: 👁️ Vision-Based Selector Inference

Uses **Claude Vision API** to analyze PDD screenshots and infer selectors:

```
📸 Screenshot Input ──► 🧠 Claude Vision ──► 🎯 Selector Candidates
                                                   │
                                            ┌──────┴──────┐
                                            ▼             ▼
                                      High Confidence  Low Confidence
                                      (auto-applied)   (flagged for
                                                        human review)
```

- Identifies UI elements (buttons, text fields, dropdowns, tables) from screenshots
- Maps elements to process steps in the IR
- Generates candidate selectors with confidence scores
- Flags low-confidence selectors for human review

### 📦 Pre-Built Selector Libraries

Includes selector libraries for common enterprise applications:

| Application | Coverage |
|-------------|----------|
| ☁️ **Salesforce Lightning** | Login, navigation, list views, record forms, related lists, reports |
| 🏭 **SAP GUI** | Login, transaction codes, table controls, tree views, status bar |

> 💡 Add custom libraries in `knowledge/selectors/known_apps/` as JSON files.

### 🧠 Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Hybrid REFramework** | XAML state machine shell + coded C# business logic — best of both worlds |
| **RAG over fine-tuning** | 25+ knowledge base docs with API definitions, code examples, and patterns |
| **Roslyn as primary validator** | C# type system catches API hallucinations at compile time |
| **Pydantic IR as single source of truth** | Both XAML and C# generation consume the same IR |
| **4-tier selector strategy** | Live browser harvesting → Object Repository → Vision inference → TODO placeholders |
| **Lifecycle as LangGraph** | Same framework for codegen and lifecycle — checkpointing, resumption, streaming for free |
| **Hybrid = permanent** | Deterministic workflows + agent nodes where ambiguity exists — not transitional, equilibrium |
| **Testing as gate** | Validation is part of the deployment control mechanism, not downstream QA |
